# rten-examples

This crate contains example projects showing how to convert and run models for
common tasks across various modalities. See [Example
descriptions](#example-descriptions) for a summary of what each example does.

## ONNX format support

The example instructions use models in `.onnx` format. This is only supported
by rten v0.23 and later. To run examples with earlier versions of rten, you
will need to convert the models to `.rten` format first:

```sh
$ pip install rten-convert
$ rten-convert model.onnx
```

This will create a `model.rten` file in the same directory as the model.

## Running an example

Each example has a `main` function with a comment above it describing the steps
to fetch the ONNX model and run the example.

The general steps to run an example are:

1. Download the ONNX model. These usually come from [Hugging
   Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/onnx/overview),
   or ONNX format models pre-created by the model authors or community members.

2. Run the example from the `rten-examples` directory using:

   ```sh
   $ cargo run -r --bin <example_name> -- <...args>
   ```

   Where `...args` refers to the example-specific arguments, such as model
   path(s), tokenizer configuration and input data.

   Note the `-r` flag to create a **release build**. This is required as the
   examples will run very slowly in debug builds.

   The syntax and flags for an individual example can be displayed using its
   `--help` command:

   ```sh
   $ cargo run -r --bin <example_name> -- --help
   ```

   Note the `--` before `--help`. Without this `cargo` will print its own help
   info.

   You can also run examples from the root of rten repository by specifying
   the rten-examples package name:

   ```sh
   $ cargo run -p rten-examples -r --bin <example_name> -- <...args>
   ```

## Reference implementations

Some of the examples have reference implementations in Python using PyTorch and
[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). These are found in
`src/{example_name}_reference.py` and enable comparison of RTen outputs with the
original models.

## Example descriptions

The examples have been chosen to cover common tasks and popular models.
